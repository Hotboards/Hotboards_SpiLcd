  Hotboards_SpiLcd Library - Hello World

 NOTE: The lcd only works with 3.3v, you need to use an arduino that works 
 with that voltage. Another option is to use a level shifter

 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The Hotboards_SpiLcd
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 SP7032 driver presented on Spi Lcd board (http://www.hotboards.org).


 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD
 and shows the time.

  The circuit:
 *  BKL   -->  GND
 *  VDD   -->  3.3v
 *  GND   -->  GND
 *  SCLK  -->  CLK (ICSP conector)
 *  SI    -->  MOSI (ICSPs conector)
 *  CS    -->  D7
 *  RS    -->  D6
 *  RST   -->  D5

#include <SPI.h>
#include <Hotboards_SpiLcd.h>

// initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins
Hotboards_SpiLcd lcd( 7, 6, 5 );


void setup() {
  // the lcd library needs the spi interface to be initilized
  SPI.begin();
  // initialize internal lcd controller:
  lcd.begin();
  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd.print("hello, world!");
}

void loop() {
  // set the cursor to column 0, line 1
  // (note: line 1 is the second row, since counting begins with 0):
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  // print the number of seconds since reset:
  lcd.print(millis() / 1000);
}
